    <h1>About Swim Data Analyser</h1>
    <p>This project originated as an attempt to rewrite
    the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20251112233734/https://swimmingwatchtools.com/">Swimming
    Watch Tools</a> using client-side data
    processing. Swimming Watch Tools is now deprecated and links to this
    site. In its current state, the project provides full parsing and
    analysis capabilities through JavaScript that loads with the
    website. Once the site is fully loaded, you can even analyse
    workouts without an internet connection. On some browsers, you can
    also install the app for offline use, thanks to its implementation
    as a Progressive Web App (PWA).</p>

    <p>The goal of this project is to build on free and open-source
    software wherever possible. While this is true for most of the
    components, parsing and encoding .fit files currently relies on
    Garmin’s proprietary SDK. If you have suggestions for an
    free (licence wise) alternative, I’d love to hear them.</p>

    <p>Future plans include extending current functionality beyond
    Swimming Watch Tools, with a focus on long-term analysis of swim
    workouts, which would require account handling. Basic parsing and
    analysis of single workouts will remain client-side for casual
    website users.</p>

    <p>Everyone is welcome to contribute ideas, feature requests, and
    thoughts via email
    (<a href="mailto:shelf-hosted@posteo.net">shelf-hosted@posteo.net</a>)
    or
    on <a href="https://github.com/PeterK-end/swim-data-analyser">GitHub</a>.</p>

    <h3>Notes on current implementation</h3>

    <p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <i>"Best Efforts"</i>: Currently, best effort records are removed upon export.
        If you are correcting a file, it is very likely that any best effort or
        personal record contained within it is incorrect. Determining whether a
        time is a personal record from a single FIT file alone is not possible.
      </li>
    </ul>
